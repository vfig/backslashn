## Making a Profit (2018; Thief Gold)

![Manor house interior](profit-manor.jpg)

**Created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Thief: The Dark Project**

My debut Thief mission, _Making a Profit_ is a microcosm of Thief gameplay and storytelling: "a simple job" that goes wrong, enmeshing the player-character Garrett in events larger than himself, forcing him to take action to put things right again. The mission features:
- A developing plot with changing objectives.
- City streets that are open for free exploration, while gently guiding the player into the plot.
- Rich gameplay variety: plundering a rich noble's mansion; kidnapping a Hammerite religious official from a cathedral; exploring dark, haunted catacombs; solving an ancient puzzle tomb.
- A seamless, dynamic musicscape that changes in response to geography and plot.
- A highly polished experience: robust custom scripting; animated briefing video; hand-drawn maps; voice acted player character and npcs. (briefing artworks and voice acting by contributors)

**Reviews:**

> [skacky](https://www.thiefguild.com/topics/14197/as-good-as-it-is-ambitious): As good as it is ambitious! ... The sheer amount of locations you'll visit is also staggering: a cathedral, a manor, a cemetery ... This mission is overall packed with stuff to do and the scripting is absolutely stellar. ... Overall I think Making a Profit is a stellar debut and definitely an incredible mission that everyone needs to play.

> [Melan](https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=124349&page=119&p=2415610&viewfull=1#post2415610): Where this mission shines, however, is the combination of gameplay and story. Multiple styles of stealth objectives found in Thief are integrated into a seamless whole ... it feels like a ride of a story from the first twist to the finale. It is technically accomplished and just a lot of fun. This is a FM by a builder who has an understanding of what makes Thief tick – and the skills to recapture its peculiar magic.

## Door Challenge II (2018; Half-Life 2)

![The bunker's closed door](door2_vfig_01.jpg)

**"Build a puzzle and craft a story to creatively open 'The Door'"**

Created for the mapcore.org "Door Challenge II" with the brief above. You need to open the door to a bomb shelter to survive an approaching missile. Talk to the NPCs standing around, each of whom knows only a glimpse of the answer, and communicates it obliquely; when you solve their riddle, you will understand how to survive.

- A short exercise in scripting and creatively working with constraints.
- Custom (clunky) system for conversing with NPCs.
- Environment and sounds sourced from Half-Life 2, in order to establish the desired mood.

## Escherisch (2011; Half-Life 2 Episode 2)

![](escherisch0002.jpg)

**Build an entire level contained within a 1024x1024x1024 cube**

Created for the mapcore.org "Cube Challenge" with the brief above. I approached this as a building challenge, trying to make the very small space allowed seem much larger than it is. The level contains no other gameplay.

- A short exercise in architecture and creatively working within the very tight space constraints.
- Seamless teleports and self-skybox tricks expand the walkable space in unexpected ways.
- An unconventional art style, with architecture inspired by M. C. Escher's illustrations.

## KotH: Skylab (2012; Team Fortress 2)

![The central capture point](koth_skylab-cap_point.jpg)

**King of the Hill multiplayer combat, in space**

This is a King of the Hill map, with action tightly focused around a central capture point. With numerous approaches to the point, the action tends to be fast and furious. I designed this central room for a tf2maps.net contest, then subsequently expanded the concept into a small but complete map.

- All new creatures, behaviours, and mechanics.
- Capabilities never seen before in the Dark Engine, enabled by custom script modules and custom Blender addons.
